								<strong>A. Stage 1 Pneumatic Cleaning Machine (TrapBlaster) must have:</strong><br><br>

								<li>Bi-directional cleaning for DPFs and DOCs (catalyst)</li>
								<li>Dual scanning air knives with a minimum of 120 CFM or 3400 liters per minute/ 100 PSI or 7 Bar dry air delivered to TrapBlaster addressing both ends of the DPF simultaneously</li> 
								<li>Automatic cleaning mode with timer that activates signal light to alert operator the timer has expired and to observe if cleaning has completed</li>
								<li>On-the-fly electronically controlled manual override to allow custom cleaning on specific areas of the DPF if needed</li>
								<li>Hold the DPF vertically during cleaning to take advantage of gravity and dust collector air direction</li>
								<li>A window allowing the operator to see the ash exiting the DPF to confirm when the cleaning process is completed</li>
								<li>Diagnostic feature shall be built into the cleaning action allowing the detection of failed cells, cracks and defective filters</li>
								<li>An upper and lower window with internal lights allowing the operator to observe filter cleaning and potential bypass</li>
								<li>Complete set of adapter plates to accommodate DPF ranging from 6” to 16” diameter</li>
								<li>Adjustable to clean DPFs up to 36” long or as small as 6” in length</li>
								<li>The nozzle travel distance shall be 14" and can be used on either radius or diameter</li>
								<li>An adjustable nozzle system that allows cleaning under filter flanges and into recessed cavities</li>
								<li>Electronically controlled adjustment for DPF height</li>
								<li>Variable speed rotation of the DPF during the cleaning cycle</li><br>
								<strong>B. Stage 2 Thermal Regeneration (TrapBurner) must have:</strong><br><br>

								<li>Pre-programmed and reprogrammable controller that can be adjusted by the contractor</li>
								<li>Pre-programmed bake cycles that meet OEM specifications</li>
								<li>Uses ambient air; no air pumped into DPF during bake cycle</li>
								<li>Expandable to accommodate two or three DPF per bake cycle</li>
								<li>Fume collection duct to remote dust collector</li>
								<li>One-touch program selection</li>
								<li>Top loading to allow for use of overhead jib boom or crane</li><br>
								<strong>C. Testing and Certification Equipment (TrapTester) must have:</strong><br><br>

								<li>Test flow bench shall have a minimum airflow of 850 CFM</li>
								<li>Measurement shall be in inches of water column (w.g.) of pressure across the DPF</li>
								<li>Published baselines of most DPF's on the market for comparison during the testing</li>
								<li>Established flow criteria to determine when a DPF is completed or if it needs Stage 2 cleaning</li><br>
								<strong>D. Dust Collection System (SootSucker) must have:</strong><br><br>

								<li>Two-stage filtration system that includes a primary and HEPA filter</li>
								<li>Minimum of 1400 CFM with new filters</li>
								<li>Primary filter that has a minimum efficiency of 100% at 3.46 to 8.37 Microns</li>
								<li>HEPA filter rated to 99.97% efficient to 0.3 Microns</li>
								<li>Self cleaning pulse jet to keep primary filter lasting about 300 DPF cleanings</li>
								<li>Quick release foot pedal dust collection bucket for ease of disposal</li>
