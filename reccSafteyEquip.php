					<p>Diesel Soot and Ash are known byproducts of diesel exhaust.
					 These by products have been determined to be a health hazard, 
					 and the requirements surrounding worker safety vary between 
					 Federal, State, and local regulatory bodies. As a minimum the 
					 same precautions should be taken while cleaning DPFs that are 
					 taken when working on any other part of the exhaust system. 
					 Consult your local emissions authority for more information.

					<h3>Shop Equipment recommendations</h3>
						<p>While every shop is unique, all share some common characteristics and risks.
						 Equipping your shop with the proper tools and equipment in the long run makes 
						 the cleaning of your DPFs a more effiicient process, improves worker safety, and
						  allows you to process more DPFs in a given space while maintaining the highest 
						  processing quality. Below are some of the items you may wish to consider to 
						  make your shop as productive, safe, and efficien<a href="sootsucker2.php">
						  <img src="img/SootSuckerS.jpg" alt="FSX SootSucker" width="108" height="170" align="right"></a>t as possible.
						</p>
						<ol>
		                <li><strong>High quality dust collection system</strong> -The proper dust collection system will 
		                	not only efficiently gather the cleaning byproducts, but will also prevent material from entering
		                	 the dust collector exhaust stream and discharging it outside or back into the shop. FSX dust collectors,
		                	  such as the <a href="sootsucker2.php">SootSucker 2</a>,    
		                	  has been designed to handle the flow of  particulate coming out of the FSX TrapBlaster. 
		                	  Special focus was concentrated on  maximizing the life of the internal paper filters, lowering 
		                	  your consumables  cost and exposure to Particulate Matter (PM).<br>
		                  <br>
		                </li>
		                <li><strong>Overhead cranes or jib booms with an electric hoist and <a href = "#fifthModal" data-toggle = "modal" data-target = "#fifthModal"></strong> - <br>
		                  <strong><a href = "#fifthModal" data-toggle = "modal" data-target = "#fifthModal"><img src="img/tongsM.jpg" alt="FSX TrapTongs" width="91" height="140" align="left"></a></strong>
		                  This solution can behuge improvement to your operation in a number of ways. DPFs are heavy - some
		                  <img src="img/tonguseS.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="98" align="right"> wieghing over 70 lbs. Using a crane
		                   or jib boom with a winch and <a href = "#fifthModal" data-toggle = "modal" data-target = "#fifthModal">TrapTongs</a> prevents injuries, protects your TrapBurner kiln,
		                    and protects your customer filters from inadvertent damage during handling.<br>

		                </li>
		                <li><strong>Roll carts</strong> - There are several varieties of rolling carts available to help make handling 
		                	your DPFs easier. While it may seem trivial and un-needed, one broken flange on a customer DPF can make the 
		                	cost of a simple cart a stronger consideration. Here at FSX we use one that has a hydraulic scissor table that
		                	 allows easier lifting of particularly heavy filters.<br>
		                  <br>
		                </li>
		                <li><strong>Conveyors</strong> - In particularly large DPF cleaning operations where multiple cleaning machines cover
		                 a large area, some customers utilize conveyor or roller-rack systems to efficiently move DPFs from storage areas to
		                  <img src="img/forkjack.jpg" alt="fork lift pallet jack" width="300" height="298" align="right">(and between)

		                  <br>
		                </li>
		                <li><strong>Forklifts / pallet jacks</strong> - While a rolling cart is helpful in many instances, DPF are frequently
		                 shipped and/or stored within the cleaning facility on freight pallets. Having a forklift or a pallet jack handy can 
		                 make life in the cleaning center a lot easier to manage.</li>

	                          The FSX TrapTong™ is probably one of most labor-saving devices ever created
	                           to assist in Thermal Cleaning Diesel Particulate Filters.<br><br>

	                          Many DPF filters can weigh up to 70lb, and the TrapTong™ provides a reliable
	                           grip for moving filter media while minimizing the risk of costly personnel injury.<br><br>

	                          FSX TrapTongs™ have a lift limit of 350 lbs with a 2:1 safety margin.<br><br>

	                          Custom-made of hardened steel, the TrapTong™ is capable of lifting DPF filters 
	                          from any angle, and at any temperature!<br><br>
