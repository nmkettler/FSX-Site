					low level hazardous waste in some states such as California. Check with your 
					local or state environmental agencies before disposal. Dispose of cleaning 
					byproducts in accordance with your local regulations.

      				The  paper filters used in the <a href="sootsucker2.php">FSX SootSucker™</a> were designed for long life.
      				 One of the many advantages, both from an operation and an environmental standpoint is that over 250 DPFs can be cleaned using 
      				 the SootSucker 2 before  the paper filter needs to be replaced. Competing dust collector designs require you to change the filters
      				  between every 10 and 50 DPFs, increasing the cost of operation and the impact to the environment. 
      				  <a href="sootsucker2.php">FSX SootSucker ™</a> dust collectors save you money and substantially reduce your environmental impact!
      			</p>
      			<p>
      				The FSX primary paper filter cartridge can be cleaned and  reused. We encourage you to check your local area for industrial 
      				filter  cleaning company that can provide this service.
      			</p>
      			<p> 
      				When paper filters need to be disposed, you need to follow local environmental regulations since they contain the same diesel
      				soot and ash found in all other exhaust system components.
