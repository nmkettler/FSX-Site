							Pneumatic DPF Cleaner</h2>
            <p class = "">The TrapBlaster™ supports two modes of operation:</br> 
							<strong>FullAir mode</strong> - 120 CFM/100 PSI of dry air delivered 
							to the TrapBlaster running Full Air Mode. Usually this 
							can be accomplished using a 30 to 40 HP air compressor
							depending on air compressor manufacturer, air dryer used, 
							pipe configuration and altitude.</br></br>
							<strong>AirSaver mode</strong> - For lower volume shops get your filters 
							"FSX Clean" with a minimum of 60 CFM/ 100 PSI of dry air delivered to the 
							TrapBlaster, typically with a 20hp or greater compressor. AirSaver mode has 
							been certified to clean filters just as well as FullAir mode. With a smaller 
							air supply and alternating upper and lower air blast nozzles, the same level 
							of cleaning is performed by extending the process time.</br></br>

			      <h3>Features</h3>
			      <p>
			      	<li>The TrapBlaster™ is the flagship of the FSX product line, utilizing patented technology 
			      		to clean filters significantly better than competing designs.</li>
					<li>Using automatic or manual operation, the operator can immediately see the progress and 
						status of the filter cleaning operation as it happens - no more "guessing" whether the filter
						 is clean. If cells are particularly bad, switch to manual operation and spot-clean the affected areas.</li>
					<li>Upper and lower air jets allow cleaning from both ends of the filter, not just one. The FSX technology
					 has a built in diagnostic feature that makes it possible to detect filters that are failing.</li>
					<li>Surprisingly quiet operation and a ton of additional features make the TrapBlaster™ the hands-down choice for DPF cleaning.</li>
					<li>Fully automatic operation with manual capabilities for custom cleaning of particularly bad filters.</li>
					<li>High pressure air jets clean from both ends to ensure optimum filter recovery.</li>
					<li>Cell by cell cleaning ensures entire filter is cleaned.</li>
					<li>High visibility design eliminates guesswork during the cleaning process.</li>
					<li>Diagnostic features during cleaning allow detection of failed cell walls and defective filters.</li>
					<li>Adjustable nozzles allow access to hard to reach flanges and recessed cavities.</li>
					<li>Fully adjustable for filter height to 36" and 20" diameter.</li>
					<li>"Side Stitch" mode allows focused cleaning on outer edge of filters typically undercleaned by other systems.</li>
